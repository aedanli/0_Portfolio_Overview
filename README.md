A high-level overview of my Data Portfolio.

# Summary
Hi! Thank you for taking the time to read through my portfolio. This portfolio contains the highlights of a few personal projects I have recently worked on, as well as a high-level overview of my research conducted during graduate school and as a postdoctoral fellow.

The aim is to show my interests and expertise in using a wide range of data analytics to tackle research-based and real-world problems. Furthermore, I aim to show that I can summarize almost a decade of research on the human mind succinctly via visualizations.

# List of Projects in the Portfolio

## 1. Video Game Recommendations

I analyzed and visualized over 76,000+ video game titles, identifying general trends and factors predictive of purchases using linear and random forest regressions. I then built a content-based recommender that can provide similar high-rated games to any title available on Steam.

## 2. Text Content Classification

I built a content-based classifier using 22000+ online newspaper headlines, tuned the classifier on an imbalanced class label (1:10 ratio), and then generalized it to a new dataset without labels. This project successfully predicted “Science” articles from BBC news headlines.

## 3. Studying Memory with Real-Time Temporal Dynamics

Encompassing several projects, this work developed a new method to measure human memory continuously using mouse cursor movements over a 2D object embedding. I then generalized the approach to virtual reality, with initial results showing that this task can effectively screen older adults at risk for dementia.

## 4. How Does the Brain Create New Concepts?

This neuroimaging research provides one solution to the binding problem, finding that the mind combines the senses (e.g., eyes and ears) into a coherent concept using a hierarchical architecture. I built a cutting-edge multi-echo fMRI pipeline, recording brain activity as participants learned new 3D-printed objects.

## 5. Brain Inspired Neural Network Architecture 

Building from my findings in Project 4, this ongoing work aims to develop a brain inspired architecture for artificial neural networks during object classification. We can use what we know about how the brain creates object concepts to inform how we design our neural networks.
